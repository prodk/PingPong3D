PingPong3D
----------
PingPong3D - a simple casual game. 
The idea was taken from the old arcade 2D game PingPong and then extended to the 3D case.

The game has been developed using C++ and Visual Studio 2010 on Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate x64.

Basic libraries: SDL, OpenGL (GLU, GLUT), CML, FMOD.

The github repository is self-containing, it has all the necessary header/library files (except for OpenGL, which is assumed to be present on the machine). 

To run the game, just go to the Release directory and double click PingPong3D.exe.
